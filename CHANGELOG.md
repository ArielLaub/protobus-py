# Changelog

All notable changes to **protobus-py** are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Server-streaming RPC.** Methods declared `rpc foo (Req) returns (stream Chunk)`
  in `.proto` return an `AsyncIterator[Chunk]` on the client (consumed with
  `async for`) and accept an async-generator handler on the server. End-of-stream
  is signaled via the `x-protobus-final` AMQP header — no `ResponseContainer`
  schema change. See [`docs/advanced/streaming.md`](docs/advanced/streaming.md).
- **Cross-language compatibility.** A TS client (`protobus@1.4.0`) drives a
  Python streaming server identically to a Python client. The chat-path
  topology (API in TS → ChatAgent in Python) is the motivating case and is
  verified by `protobus`'s `test/integration/cross-language.test.ts`.
- New errors: `StreamingError`, `StreamTimeoutError`, `StreamBackpressureError`,
  `StreamClosedError`.
- New config: `STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` env var (default `60000` ms) — idle
  timeout between streaming chunks. Streaming calls do NOT use
  `MESSAGE_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT` — a stream may legitimately take far longer
  than any single chunk gap.
- New public API: `Context.publish_streaming_message()`,
  `MessageDispatcher.publish_streaming()`, `MessageFactory.is_streaming_method()`.

### Fixed

- **Version drift between `pyproject.toml` and `protobus/__init__.py`.**
  These had silently disagreed (1.3.2 vs 1.2.1) since an earlier release.
  Both are now aligned at 1.4.0; release scripts should keep them in lockstep.

### Changed

- `MessageHandler` type alias gained an optional `headers` parameter:
  `Callable[[bytes, str, dict], Awaitable[Any]]`. Existing handlers with the
  old 2-arg signature keep working — `headers` has a default value where the
  framework calls handlers.
- Handlers may now return an `AsyncIterator[bytes]` (in addition to
  `Optional[bytes]`) to drive a streaming reply.

### Notes

- Tests: 55/55 pass (44 existing + 11 streaming).
- Requires `protoc` on PATH for descriptor-pool loading (unchanged from prior
  releases). The Homebrew package `protobuf` provides this on macOS.
