## The choice

Most Python microservice frameworks are **transport-agnostic**: they abstract
the message broker so that RabbitMQ, Redis, NATS or Kafka can be swapped
underneath the same application code. That is a real feature, and if you need
it, protobus is the wrong library.

ProtoBus makes the opposite trade. It targets **RabbitMQ only**, and the things
a broker is good at are left to the broker rather than implemented above it:

| Concern | Where it lives in protobus |
|---|---|
| Load balancing | competing consumers on one queue |
| Routing | topic exchange bindings (`REQUEST.<Service>.*`) |
| Redelivery on consumer loss | late ack — an unacked delivery returns to the queue |
| Retry delay | the retry queue's `x-message-ttl`, drained by DLX |
| Persistence | durable queues, persistent messages |
| Dead letters | a real `<Service>.DLQ` |
| Priority | native queue priorities |

Two consequences follow from that, and they are the whole argument for the
library:

**There is less protobus in the path.** A message goes from a publisher to a
RabbitMQ exchange to a queue to a consumer. No process holds a registry of live
instances, so no process has a stale one. When a consumer dies mid-request, its
delivery was never acked and the broker gives it to another consumer — that is
queue behaviour, not recovery code.

**There is less protobus to reimplement.** See below.

What this costs you is written down honestly elsewhere: read
[Delivery Guarantees](./concepts/delivery-guarantees.md) before relying on any
of it, in particular [the one hop protobus does not
confirm](./concepts/delivery-guarantees.md#where-a-message-can-still-be-lost)
and [where duplicates come
from](./concepts/delivery-guarantees.md#where-duplicates-come-from).

## Porting to another language

This is the advantage that holds up best, and it comes from two connected
choices rather than from any single feature.

**A small dependency surface.** Two runtime dependencies: `aiormq` and
`protobuf`. Pure logic translates to another language fairly mechanically and
can be checked against shared tests. A dependency boundary does not — different
API shapes, concurrency models, error handling and lifecycle semantics all have
to be re-established, and preserving behaviour across that boundary is where
the work actually is. Protobus has one such boundary that matters, the AMQP
client, and this port is the worked example: the TypeScript original speaks
`amqplib`, this one speaks `aiormq`, and everything above that line is the same
design.

**Broker-owned messaging behaviour.** Queueing, consumer distribution, retry
delays and dead-lettering are not translated at all, because they are not in
the library. They stay in RabbitMQ while you change the service language.
Service discovery and failure recovery — the parts hardest to validate in a
port — are not code a port inherits.

So the accurate claim is: *a small dependency surface plus broker-owned
messaging behaviour reduces the code and integration work another language
implementation requires.* Not that there is nothing to implement.

### There is an application protocol, and you do implement it

Protobuf over AMQP is not self-describing. A peer has to speak protobus's own
conventions:

- three envelope messages — `RequestContainer`, `ResponseContainer`,
  `EventContainer`
- the routing-key scheme, `REQUEST.<Service>.<method>`, and the rule that the
  envelope's `method` must agree with it
- the three exchanges — `proto.bus`, `proto.bus.callback`, `proto.bus.events` —
  and how replies are addressed by `reply_to` with `correlation_id` echoed
- the error encoding on `ResponseContainer`
- for streaming, the `x-protobus-*` headers

That is a small protocol and it is written down in
[Message Flow](./concepts/message-flow.md), envelope definitions included. It is
not a protocol you can skip.

### The evidence

- This library and [protobus](https://github.com/ArielLaub/protobus)
  (TypeScript) interoperate: a Python service serves TypeScript callers and
  vice versa, streaming, events, custom types and error codes included.
- [`tests/integration/test_cross_language.py`](../tests/integration/test_cross_language.py)
  runs a Python client against a TypeScript server over a real broker, and the
  TypeScript repository's `cross-language.test.ts` does the reverse. Both run
  in [CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) on every commit.

## What ProtoBus is not

- **Not transport-portable.** RabbitMQ is not an implementation detail here; it
  is the design. There is no adapter layer to point at Kafka.
- **Not a web framework.** No HTTP, no GraphQL, no WebSockets, no DI container,
  no API gateway. It moves messages between services.
- **Not schemaless.** Every call is a `.proto` contract. If you want to send an
  ad-hoc object, this is friction, not a feature.
- **Not exactly-once, and not lossless.** See
  [Delivery Guarantees](./concepts/delivery-guarantees.md).
- **Not a retry system for events by default.** A failed event handler drops
  its event unless the service opts in to the event retry ladder — a
  deliberate default with real consequences. See
  [Events → Retry](./guide/events.md#retry) and
  [Known Issues](./operations/known-issues.md).

### Other options

If you are comparing, read their own documentation rather than a summary
written by a competitor:

- [Nameko](https://www.nameko.io/) — RabbitMQ-based, with RPC and events, built
  on eventlet rather than asyncio
- [FastStream](https://faststream.airt.ai/) — transport-agnostic (RabbitMQ,
  Kafka, NATS, Redis), Pydantic-typed, asyncio-native
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/) — a task queue rather than a service bus;
  fire-and-forget jobs with results as an afterthought
- [MassTransit](https://masstransit.io/) — .NET, and closest in philosophy to
  protobus in that it leans on the broker rather than abstracting it

## When to choose ProtoBus

Choose it when:

- **RabbitMQ is already your broker**, or you are happy to commit to it
- **You want the broker's behaviour rather than a reimplementation of it** —
  competing consumers, topic routing, DLX, priorities
- **Contracts matter more than convenience** — `.proto` files as the interface
  between teams, and generated typing that fails the type-check when they drift
- **You expect more than one language on the bus** — the TypeScript port is
  verified compatible on every commit
- **You want a small dependency footprint** you can read end to end

Choose something else when:

- **You may need to change brokers**
- **You want one framework for HTTP, GraphQL and messaging**
- **JSON is fine** and a schema step is overhead you do not want
- **Your messages are ad-hoc** and pinning them to a contract would slow you down
- **You are not on asyncio** — every protobus API is a coroutine

## Performance

No benchmark harness is committed to this repository, and no numbers are
claimed for this port. The TypeScript project's README records a comparison
against Moleculer measured by its authors; nothing there has been re-measured
here, and a Python service will not reproduce a Node number in any case.

What the architecture would predict, separately from any measurement:

- Protobuf encodes to fewer bytes than the equivalent JSON, so there is less to
  write and read.
- Encoding and decoding run in the `protobuf` package's C++ (upb) runtime, not
  in Python.
- Routing decisions happen in the broker, so they do not run on your event
  loop.
- One process is one asyncio loop, so throughput scales by process count, not
  by `max_concurrent` — see [Getting Started → Project
  layout](./guide/getting-started.md#project-layout).

Whether any of that is visible in your workload is an empirical question.
Measure your own: payload shape dominates, and the gap on a 100-byte message is
not the gap on a 139 KB one. A runnable harness alongside
[`scripts/run-combat-sample.sh`](../scripts/run-combat-sample.sh) would be a
welcome contribution.
